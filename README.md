# G000187_Bhavana_Yasmin_heart_paper

Code used to process mini-bulk RNA-seq data for `G000187_Bhavana_Yasmin` 'heart paper' using [**scPipe**](	https://bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe/); see [`code/scPipe.R`](code/scPipe.R).

The `G000187_Bhavana_Yasmin` project contains data from 2 papers, the 'heart paper' and another, which were originally processed together as one.
Bhavana and Yasmin requested that only the 'heart paper' data be made public at this time, so this repository contains code that reproduces the data used in 'heart paper' and masks or omits the phenotypes of the other samples in broader dataset.
